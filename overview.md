# AMEP – Adaptive Mastery & Engagement Platform

## Overview

AMEP (Adaptive Mastery & Engagement Platform) is an education-focused platform
designed to improve learning outcomes, classroom engagement, and project-based
learning through data-driven insights.

The platform addresses common challenges in modern education, including:
- One-size-fits-all teaching approaches
- Lack of visibility into quiet or disengaged students
- Subjective evaluation of teamwork and soft skills
- High teacher workload due to fragmented tools and manual processes

AMEP brings these capabilities together into a single, unified system.
